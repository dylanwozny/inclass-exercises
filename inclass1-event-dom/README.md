# In Class Exercise 1 - Working with Functions [2.5%]

Create a function named italics that accepts a single parameter value and returns that value enclosed within `<i>` tags (very similar to the strong function).

<!-- Once done, combine this new function with the updateInnerHTML function to update the span.note innerHTML to its current value, but with the `<i>` tags added. -->

Save your code in js/main.js, and ensure that this file is properly linked to your HTML page so the code executes when the page is loaded in the browser.The final HTML for p.important should look as follows:

```html
<p class="important">
  <span class="note"><i>Note:</i></span
  >Functions are first-class objects in JavaScript, and so can be treated just
  as any other object that you might use.
</p>
```
