# In Class Exercise 2 - Working with Events [2.5%]

Using what you have learned in class and through the exercise, make the following updates to your solution:

1.Currently, the alt attribute of img.feature is set to ‘no image’. Your task is to update the current featureLinkHandler function with the necessary code that will set the value of the img.featurealt attribute to the value of the featureLink title attribute.

2.You will notice in the html there is a p.feature.title element with no content. As you may have surmised, this is by design. Your task is to add an event listener on the img.feature element for the mouseover event that will set the innerHTML of p.feature.title to the value of the alt attribute from the img.feature. (As always, take some time to devise a plan before beginning to write any code.)

3.[Optional] Add an event listener that will reset the innerHTML of p.feature.title to nothing when the mouse is moved away from the img.feature

Please submit the link to your repository to the assessment when you are complete.
